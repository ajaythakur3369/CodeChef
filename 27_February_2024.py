Task:- 
Variables in Python
A variable is like a labeled box where you can store data. Imagine you have a box labeled "age" and you put the number 25 in it. In Python, you would do this by writing age = 25. This means you're storing the number 25 in the variable named age.

Here's the cool part: whenever you use age in your code, Python will remember it is 25. For example, if you write print(age), Python will show 25.
 Create a variable in editor named age and assign the value 25 to it.
 Print the value of age variable using print statement.
