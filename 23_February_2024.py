Inserting text Between Outputs
Remember that to print multiple values on same line, we have to use comma inside print statement.

We can also use comma to separate text and numbers in a single print statement.

For example, check the below code
'''

print("My favorite number is", 10)

The code will output:

My favorite number is 10
