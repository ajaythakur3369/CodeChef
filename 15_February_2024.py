Task:- 
In the editor we have written half code for you. Some portion of the code contains __ (underscores). Remove those underscore and write 21 in place of first underscore and 40 in place of the next underscore.
To pass this exercise, your code has to print the sum of 21 and 40.

You may have noticed the 1st line in the editor having instructions for you. These lines are not code, they are called comments. Comments in Python start with a #. You can write anything inside a comment.
